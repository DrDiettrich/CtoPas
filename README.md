# CtoPas
C to Pascal source code converter

This is the revival of a project of 2004, see the Wiki for details.

WinToPas is a Delphi(7) GUI project, to create D7 units from C source files (*.c, *.h). 

The C parser is almost C99 compatible, with some C11 extensions. It requires standard header files of a compiler, Cygwin may be sufficient.

The code generator outputs D7 units, as far as Delphi syntax allows.

Macro handling deserves further development efforts.

All tested with Windows.h of the most recent VS Express version (15).
